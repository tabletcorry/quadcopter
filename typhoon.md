Typhoon
=======

My first quadcopter. Purchased as the AeroQuad Typhoon ARF Kit at Maker Faire

Base:
* Frame: Aeroquad Typhoon
* Flight computer: Naza M v2 (originally, Aeroquad 32 v2)
* RC Reciever: Spektrum AR610
* Motors: 4x A2212-13 Brushless Motors (probably)
* ESCs: 4x 30 Amp Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC's)
* Props: 10x4.5

Add Ons:
* GPS & Compass: Naza GPS (Originally, no gps)

Comments:
The typhoon frame is amazing. I have crashed it three times, and it still flies (after manually bending it back into shape.)

The Aeroquad controller is very agile, but more advanced features like altitude hold are extremely incomplete. It could barely hold altitude within in 10m band.
